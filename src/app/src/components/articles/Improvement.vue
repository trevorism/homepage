      <p class="mb-2">
          Improvement is the key to success. Society wants and therefore rewards productivity,
          so gains in this area are very valuable. I will describe a framework for sustained
          improvement that can be applied to oneself, and can be scaled to teams and organizations.
          The secret lies within computer science and software engineering! Before that secret is revealed,
          let’s introduce a few concepts..
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold -ml-4 mb-2">
        Scientific Method
      </h2>

      <p class="mb-2">
        The Scientific Method is the best way to form new knowledge about the world.
        The feature that makes this process so effective is the rigor it imposes on knowledge creation;
        we must get repeatable, peer-reviewed, empirical results before hypotheses are accepted as facts.
        Outcomes are documented and the resultant facts offer themselves up to be disproven at any time.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold -ml-4 mb-2">
        Computer Science
      </h2>

      <p class="mb-2">
        Most think of Computer Science as the study of computation, but fundamentally computation is a process
        of taking inputs into a desired outcome. In our case, we want to take our life experiences as input,
        and make productivity gains the result. Can such a software system be built?
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold -ml-4 mb-2">
        Feedback Loop
      </h2>

      <p class="mb-2">
        Achieving a long term goal must happen one step at a time. A feedback loop is an incredibly useful concept
        for ensuring each step brings you closer to your goal. It consists of three parts: a prediction;
        actions to bring about a result; and evaluation of the outcome. Evaluation is the hardest part --
        it takes experience to understand how to properly evaluate a process. The world is a dynamic place
        and external factors (luck) can have dramatic effects. Setting up objective measurements and appealing
        to others are the best ways to evaluate an outcome in lieu of personal experience.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold -ml-4 mb-2">
        Engineering
      </h2>

      <p class="mb-2">
        So far, we’ve introduced concepts, but Engineering forces us to make these concepts tangible.
        We must consider constraints on time and energy and make practical decisions. Setting quantitative expectations,
        and measuring the results are important facets of engineering, but nothing compares to taking immediate action.
        Note that thought experiments are the opposite of engineering gains in productivity.
        We weigh the potential value of any action against the cost of valuable resources.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold -ml-4 mb-2">
        Scientific Improvement
      </h2>

      <p class="mb-2">
        With the above concepts as tools, we can now put together a framework for scientific improvement.
        First, one should establish several feedback loops as one progresses towards a long term goal. Remember it has three parts:
        a prediction (hypothesis), action (an experiment) and evaluation. Create visibility by writing down
        and publicizing the feedback loops. Here are some important details:
      </p>

      <div class="mb-2 ml-2">
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
          <li>The prediction should include what will happen in the experiment, and when the evaluation will be completed. </li>
          <li>
            The action should occur as soon as possible. From engineering, we know we have limited time and resources,
            so we must apply them when they are available.
          </li>
          <li>
            The evaluation should include some quantitative measure of the result, or leverage the opinion of the best
            people you can find.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p class="mb-2">
        The framework for scientific improvement is to create a feedback loop on your set of feedback loops.
        We rigorously measure the effectiveness of the loops, attempting to:
      </p>

      <div class="mb-2 ml-2">
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
          <li>Increase the number of feedback loops, using mistakes or gaps in the process as an opportunity to install another loop. </li>
          <li>Increase the frequency of their use. </li>
          <li>Shorten the length of time spent within the feedback loop.</li>
          <li>Improve the evaluation by attempting experiments over time, and by seeking out more expertise.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p class="mb-2">
        Commit to using each feedback loop within a period of time, usually a week or a month. At the end of this time period,
        any unused feedback loops should be re-evaluated, either recommitted or removed. The recursive nature of this is an elegant way
        to automatically reinforce improvement.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-2">
        We can use software to automate and visualize many aspects of this framework. Trevorism.com offers the tools to
        perform keep lists, set expectations, measure results, and visualize outcomes, all open-source and freely available.
        Through automation, one can achieve inhuman levels of productivity, as software organizes and aids you on your journey.
        From a competitive standpoint, it gives you an advantage over those who do not take control of their destiny.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-2">
        Over time, you should see dramatic improvements in your productivity. By establishing a rigorous framework,
        you now have a provable documented way to improve. Since this is done scientifically, you can extend this to your
        teams and organizations. This system works for individuals, teams, and organizations. It is the key to success.
